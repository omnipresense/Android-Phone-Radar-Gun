# Android-Phone-Radar-Gun
Turn any Android Phone supporting USB-OTG into a radar gun.  Utilizes the same 24GHz radar as the police use.

This project makes extensive use of the USB Serial library found at https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial
and the example code therein.

The improved app is available from the Google Playstore here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omnipresense.radarApp&hl=en_US
